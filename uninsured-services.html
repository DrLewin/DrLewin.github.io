                <h3>OHIP does not pay for all services that you request from your doctor.</h3>
                <p>Services that OHIP does not pay for, are called "non-insured or uninsured services" and it is illegal and fraudulent for doctors to bill OHIP for them. Just as other professionals will bill you for prompt and complete services, it is legal for me to charge for these third party requested services. If you have financial difficulties, please communicate this to me.</p>
                <p>Every effort has been made to account for most of the commonly requested services in this information sheet. If the uninsured service you are requesting is not listed below, I ask that you communicate this to me or my office staff for further clarification. It would also help us speed up our service, if you would let my office staff know when you are making your appointment that you are either requesting a service that is in the list below or a service for which you have been charged in the past by my office or another doctor's office.</p>
                <p>The fees contained in the list below are based on the Ontario Medical Association's recommended fees for 2012. </p>
                <p><strong>All uninsured services must be paid in full when rendered.</strong> You have the right to receive a receipt and my office staff will provide you with one upon settlement of your account.</p>
                <p>Should you be unable to pay for the uninsured service at the time it is provided, please let my office staff know when and how you intend to settle your outstanding account. We will make every effort possible to assist you in the settlement of your outstanding account. </p>
                <p>Please note that our office accepts cheques and cash payments. Where applicable, a charge of $20.00 for personal cheques that are returned N.S.F. by financial institutions will be added to patients' accounts. Thank you for your cooperation. </p>
