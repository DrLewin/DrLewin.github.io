                        <p>The building is 770 Broadview Ave. Suite 207 across from Pizza Pizza. My secretary has many years experience as a medical secretary. At Broadview Medical Centre, there is a Gamma Dynacare lab and x-ray facility, as well as many doctors' offices, a pharmacy and a parking lot. The lab hours there are Monday-Thursday 7:30-4:00 and Fridays 7:30-3:30. The parking lot is paid parking with a kiosk inside the parking lot building entrance. If you prefer not to use the parking lot, there is free street parking on Broadview Avenue south of Carling and on side streets north of Carling, about 3 blocks from the building. Before 9:00 a.m. and after 5:00 p.m., street parking is free near the building.</p>

                        <p>We prefer you use Gamma-Dynacare for blood tests. They also have some locations that open at 7:00 am and some that close at 6:00 pm, as well as some that have Saturday hours. You can get information by phoning them at <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-phone"></span> 613-729-0200 or at <a href="www.gamma-dynacare.com">www.gamma-dynacare.com</a>.</p>

                        <p>People in their twenties and thirties often do not see a doctor for several years without risking their health, while older people who have developed risks for certain diseases may see a doctor more often. If you are on several medications or have more than one chronic disease, we should meet at least once a year to review management of your conditions.</p>
                        <p>You may need a checkup/appointment:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you are sick.</li>
                            <li>When you have a symptom that could mean illness.</li>
                            <li>To manage chronic or ongoing conditions.</li>
                            <li>To check on the effects of a new medicine.</li>
                            <li>To help with risk factors like smoking or obesity.</li>
                            <li>For prenatal care, if you are pregnant.</li>
                            <li>For lifestyle issues like family planning.</li>
                            <li>For other reasons that are based on your individual needs.</li>

                        <p>Usually, except when I'm away for Continuing Medical Education (to keep me up to date) and holidays. Then, my staff can help you decide where you should be seen (at my building by one of the other family doctors in my group or at the local emergency room). Please listen to the instructions on the answering machine if my staff is not available.</p>

                    <summary>What do I do for health care when the office is closed?</summary>
                    <section class="alert alert-success">
                        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span> Answer</h3>
                        <p>I recommend you call the Telephone Health Advisory Service <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-phone"></span> 1-866-553-7205 (5 p.m. to 9 a.m. weekdays, 24 hours a day on weekends) for advice over the phone first. I do not support the use of walk-in clinics, as care can be limited and they never send me reports.</p>
                        <p>At Broadview Medical Building, I work in a Family Health Organization, Broadview-Carling FHO, with 7 other family doctors. We provide coverage for each other after hours patient care. If you need medical care today, please call my office (as early as possible), as I will continue to hold some same day appointments for one problem only visits. Also, the other family doctors and I provide evening hours Monday to Thursday, 5:00-8:00 in Suite 201 that are same-day booked (listen to the answering machine message no matter the day of the week as this will be the most up to date information for you). We use a common computer database, so the physician you see after hours can access your medical records and they will record the visit and send me the information. This allows continuity of care, efficiency and improves patient safety. If you need to be seen urgently (NOT for issues that could wait until the office reopens), I ask you to use the clinic I am affiliated within the Broadview Medical Building. The doctors who work there have a regular family practice and many years of experience and a record of your visit is sent to me. No other clinics are like this.</p>
                        <p>As part of the FHO agreement, the doctors in it provide after hours services. There is also a financial penalty from the Ministry of Health if our patients go to Walk-in clinics. So, if you use a Walk-in clinic, I will be notified and penalized financially. I realize that rarely you might need to go to a clinic for urgent matters for you or your child. However, if you use them often, we will need to discuss this, as it would suggest that you would prefer your health care to be done at a Walk-in clinic. As well, if you sign a form enrolling with a clinic doctor, our doctor-patient relationship will end and I will close your chart, as you would be committing to use that clinic as your family doctor. If you are referred to a specialist or for any tests from a clinic or an emergency room, please ask them to send a copy to me. Also please note that there 2 other Dr. Lewins in the Ottawa area, so please tell them it is Dr. L.Lewin and give them my address. The Ottawa Hospital (Civic and General) emergency rooms also no longer mail a copy of your visit so please ask for a copy to bring back to me before you leave. This will save you and me a lot of time and effort later. If you have a more serious problem, such as chest pain or a suspected stroke, or any problem that may need a hospital admission, please go to the nearest Emergency Department.</p>

                    <summary>What do I do if I run out of medication?</summary>
                    <section class="alert alert-success">
                        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span> Answer</h3>
                        <p>When you come for your appointments, please have your up to date health card(keep track of the expiry date and do not ignore reminders from OHIP about updating your card) and bring all your medications (including over the counter medications and supplements) so that I keep up to date on what you are taking and can renew any prescriptions that are needed at that visit. I do not renew medications over the phone or by fax from your pharmacy as it is too time consuming. I will give you enough medication until your next regular appointment. It is your responsibility to keep track of your medication. Call the office and you will be fit in for an appointment.</p>
                        <p>As of 2011, your pharmacist can give you one month's supply of any medication you take regularly without calling me first. If you absolutely cannot come to the office, request 1 month of medication from the pharmacist and call to make an appointment for refills. The exception to this are the medications below.</p>
                        <p>As of November 1, 2011, by law, if you need a prescription that is a narcotic (such as codeine or Hycodan syrup), a stimulant (such as Ritalin or Concerta) or a tranquilizer (such as lorazepam or clonazepam) you must show ID to get the prescription and I must record that ID number on your prescription.</p>

                        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span> Answer</h3>
                        <p>I will do this at your appointments, directly with you, depending on your age, sex and medical history. The Ministry of Health also sends out reminders and results for Mammograms, Pap test results and Fecal Occult Blood tests, based on your age, sex and previous results. My staff will send reminders as well if you are overdue.</p>
                        <p>Everyone should get the recommended immunizations and screening tests at the times and frequencies as recommended by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination.</p>
                        <p>The recommendations below are for healthy adults. If you have risk factors or a chronic disease, you may need different tests or you may need a test more often. Ask your doctor what schedule is right for you, but here are conditions many people should be screened for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High blood pressure</li>
                            <li>Cervical cancer</li>
                            <li>High cholesterol on men over 40 or women over 50 who have a low risk profile</li>
                            <li>Diabetes</li>
                            <li>Breast cancer</li>
                            <li>Colon cancer</li>
                            <li>Osteoporosis (weakened bones)</li>
                            <li>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (enlarged blood vessel)</li>

                    <section class="alert alert-success">
                        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span> Answer</h3>
                        <p> You will be referred to a specialist if a specialized opinion is needed, if a procedure is required or if an operation may be necessary. If you prefer a certain specialist or hospital, let me know before the referral is made. I write a referral letter and send a copy of the appropriate tests and your past medical history to the specialist. Finding specialists can be difficult and time consuming. We will contact you ASAP when an appointment has been made; emergency referrals are made immediately. The specialist's office generally determines the waiting time for the appointment; this is out of our hands. Often, we cannot get an appointment time-the specialist's office calls you directly. If your problem gets worse before the appointment with the specialist, please make an appointment with me so that I can reassess you. If you do not hear back about a non urgent appointment within 4 weeks please call my office. Once the referral has been sent, you can call the specialist's office to see if they have a cancellation list for an earlier appointment. Please make sure that you keep the appointment as most specialists bill you for missed appointments and you would need to reschedule that appointment yourself, not through my office. I do not make multiple specialist consultations for the same problem to try to be seen sooner. I generally do not refer for problems that should be followed by a family doctor, for example: routine pap smears, annual breast exams, etc. If you choose to see a specialist without being referred, please make sure that you inform the specialist's office ahead of time that you are doing this outside of OHIP, as I will not provide a referral letter. If you wish to be seen by a dermatologist or plastic surgeon for a cosmetic reason (wrinkles, mole you dislike, skin resurfacing, etc.) this is not covered under OHIP and I do not make a referral. You can find a doctor for this through the Yellow Pages or your personal contacts then call them to make an appointment, realizing that all fees related to this are paid for by you and that all follow up related to that care is to be done there.</p>
