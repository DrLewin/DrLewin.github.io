                        <p>The building is 770 Broadview Ave. Suite 207 across from Pizza Pizza. My secretary has many years experience as a medical secretary and her name is Joan. At Broadview Medical Centre, there is a Gamma Dynacare lab and x-ray facility, as well as many doctors' offices, a pharmacy and a parking lot. The lab hours there are Monday-Thursday 7:30-4:30 and Fridays 7:30-3:30. The parking lot is paid parking with a kiosk inside the parking lot building entrance. If you prefer not to use the parking lot, there is free street parking on Broadview Avenue south of Carling and on side streets north of Carling, about 3 blocks from the building. Before 9:00 a.m. and after 5:00 p.m., street parking is allowed near the building.</p>

                        <p>Please use any Gama-Dynacare location as your lab for blood tests. Only this lab will send your results to me electronically, which means I get your results reliably and faster as this is the only local lab in Ottawa. They also have some locations that open at 7:00 am and some that close at 6:00 pm, as well as some that have Saturday hours. You can get information by phoning them at <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-phone"></span> 613-729-0200 or at <a href="http://www.gamma-dynacare.com">www.gamma-dynacare.com</a>.</p>

                        <p>Usually, except when I'm away for Continuing Medical Education (to keep me up to date) and holidays Then, my secretary Joan can help you decide where you should be seen (at my building by one of the other family doctors in my group or at the local emergency room). Please listen to the instuctions on the answering machine if Joan is not available.</p>

                    <summary>What do I do for health care when the office is closed?</summary>
                    <section class="alert alert-success">
                        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span> Answer</h3>
                        <p>I recommend you call the Telephone Health Advisory Service <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-phone"></span> 1-866-553-7205 (5 p.m. to 9 a.m. weekdays, 24 hours a day on weekends) for advice over the phone first. I do not support the use of walk-in clinics, as care can be limited and they do not send me reports.</p>
                        <p>At Broadview Medical Building, I will be working in a Family Health Organization, Broadview-Carling FHO, with other family doctors in the building. We provide coverage for each other for vacations/conferences and after hours care in the evenings (and eventually, also on Saturdays). If you need medical care that day, please call my office (as early as possible), as I will continue to hold some same day appointments for one problem only visits. Also, the other family doctors and I will provide evening hours Monday to Thursday, 5:00-8:00 in Suite 201 (listen to the answering machine message no matter the day of the week as this will be the most up to date information for you). We will be using a common database, so the physician you see after hours can access your medical records and they will record the visit and send me the information. This allows continuity of care, efficiency and improves patient safety. If you need to be seen urgently (NOT for issues that could wait until the office reopens), I ask you to use the clinic I am affiliated within the Broadview Medical Building The doctors who work there have a regular family practice and many years of experience and a record of your visit is sent to me. No other clinics are like this.</p>
                        <p>When you signed the rostering form, on the back was the Patient Commitment, which said that you agreed to contact me as your family doctor (or the Group I belong to) when you need medical advice or treatment unless there is an emergency or you are travelling. In order to encourage the doctors in the FHO to provide on call services, there is a financial penalty from the Ministry of Health if our patients are seen at Walk-in clinics. <u>So, if you use a Walk-in clinic, I will now be notified and penalized.</u> I realize that rarely you might need to go to a clinic for urgent matters for you or your child. However, if you use them often, we will need to discuss this, as it would suggest that you would prefer your health care to be done at a Walk-in clinic. As well, if you sign a form enrolling with a clinic doctor, our doctor-patient relationship will end, as you would be committing to use that clinic as your family doctor. If you are referred to a specialist or for any tests from a clinic or an emergency room, please ask them <strong>IN WRITING</strong> to send a copy to me. Also please note that there is a Dr. G. Lewin and a Dr. W. Lewin in the Ottawa area, so please tell them it is Dr. L.Lewin and give them my address. The Ottawa Hospital (Civic and General) emergency rooms also no longer mail a copy of your visit so please ask for a copy to bring back to me before you leave. This will save you and me a lot of time and effort later. If you have a more serious problem, such as chest pain or a suspected stroke, or any problem that may need a hospital admission, please go to the nearest Emergency Department.</p>

                    <summary>What do I do if I run out of medication?</summary>
                    <section class="alert alert-success">
                        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span> Answer</h3>
                        <p>When you come for your appointments, please have your up to date health card and bring all your medications (including over the counter medications and supplements) so that I keep up to date on what you are taking and can renew any prescriptions that are needed at that visit. I do not renew medications over the phone or by fax from your pharmacy as it is time consuming and prone to error. I will give you enough medication until your next regular appointment. On rare occasions, I will phone in enough medication to cover you if your appointment has been changed. Otherwise, it is your responsibility to keep track of your medication. Call the office and you will be fit in for an appointment.</p>
                        <p>As of 2011, your pharmacist can give you one month's supply of any regular medication you take without calling me first. If you absolutely cannot come in to the office, request 1 month of medication from the pharmacist and call to make an appointment fro refills. The exception to this are the medications below.</p>
                        <p>As of November 1, 2011, by law, if you need a prescription that is a narcotic (such as codeine or Hycodan syrup), a stimulant (such as Ritalin or Concerta) or a tranquilizer (such as lorazepam or clonazepam) you must show photo ID to get the prescription and I must record that photo ID number on your prescription. </p>

                    <summary>When would I get referred to a Specialist?</summary>
                    <section class="alert alert-success">
                        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign"></span> Answer</h3>
                        <p>You will be referred to a specialist if a specialized opinion is needed, if a procedure is required or if an operation is necessary. If you prefer a certain specialist or hospital, let me know before the referral is made. I write a referral letter and send a copy of the appropriate tests to the specialist. Finding specialists can be difficult and time consuming. We will contact you ASAP when an appointment has been made; emergency referrals are made immediately. The specialist's office generally determines the waiting time for the appointment; this is out of our hands. Often, we cannot get an appointment time-the specialist's office calls you directly. If your problem gets worse before the appointment with the specialist, please make an appointment with me so that I can reassess you. If you do not hear back about a non urgent appointment within 3 weeks please call my office. Once the referral has been sent, you can call the specialist's office to see if they have a cancellation list for an earlier appointment. Please make sure that you keep the appointment as most specialists bill you for missed appointments and you would need to reschedule that appointment yourself, not through my office. I do not make multiple specialist consultations for the same problem to try to be seen sooner. I generally do not refer for problems that should be followed by a family doctor, for example: routine pap smears, annual breast exams, etc. If you choose to see a specialist without being referred, please make sure that you inform the specialist's office ahead of time that you are doing this outside of OHIP, as I will not provide a referral letter. If you wish to be seen by a dermatologist or plastic surgeon for a cosmetic reason (wrinkles, mole you dislike, skin resurfacing, etc.) this is not covered under OHIP and I do not make a referral. You can find a doctor for this through the Yellow Pages or your personal contacts then call them to make an appointment, realizing that all fees related to this are paid for by you and that all follow up related to that care is to be done there.</p>
