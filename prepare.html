                <h3>Appointment time</h3>
                <p>It is important that you arrive on time or a bit ahead for your appointment. In the winter months, you may want to bring some indoor shoes with you so that when you change out of your winter boots you do not have to walk around the office in your socks. Please leave strollers in the hall outside the office unless totally dry. If you are delayed, please call and let us know, if possible. When the driving conditions are poor, I expect patients may be delayed, especially if coming by bus. The appointment time is reserved for you and if you miss it, you will be billed for the appointment</p>
                <h3>What to bring to your appointment</h3>
                <p>Please bring your OHIP card with you to every visit. Both adults and children should also bring their immunization record to checkups. It is best to bring your bottles of medications, if possible, along with a list of your medications, including the name and dose of each one. You will also need to bring information on any vitamins/dietary supplements and over-the-counter medications that you take. <strong>Please update your address and phone number and e-mail with staff at your visit and if it changes between appointments, please leave the new information on the answering machine</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Tell me your concerns</h3>
                <p>Be prepared to discuss your symptoms with me. Write down all of the issues you would like to try and cover during your visit. Begin with the most bothersome issue. This will allow me to get a clear picture upfront of what your major concerns are and appropriately attempt to address issues in the time allowed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is your main symptom/concern?</li>
                    <li>How long have you had it?</li>
                    <li>How often and when does it occur?</li>
                    <li>What makes it better or worse (e.g., activity, medication, stress)?</li>
                    <li>Is it associated with other symptoms?</li>
                    <li>Have other people in your family experienced similar health problems?</li>
                    <li>Has this problem been addressed by another physician or medical center?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Make Sure I Answer Your Questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What caused this condition?</li>
                    <li>What are my treatment options?</li>
                    <li>Which option is best for me, and why?</li>
                    <li>How will my lifestyle be affected, what will I need to change?</li>
                    <li>What am I doing right?</li>
                    <li>What am I doing wrong?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Types of appointments</h3>
                <p>The time scheduled for each visit depends upon the appointment type, therefore you MUST give my staff some idea for the reason for your appointment when it is booked. Once you have written down your concerns, you can estimate what type of appointment you will need.</p>
                <p>Monday mornings are very busy; if you are phoning in for a routine follow-up or checkup, it is best to avoid phoning on Monday mornings.</p>
                <p>I converted all the medical records from paper charts to electronic form in 2011. I do not have your paper chart as I recorded the more important parts of your chart over the past 2 years. If you want to discuss something from before 2 years ago, please tell my secretary when you book the appointment and I will bring in your paper chart for your visit.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Same day/urgent appointments (5-10 minutes)</strong> are those that you make when you are not feeling well. Examples would include respiratory infection, abdominal pain, or any new symptoms that you are experiencing. Please call as early in the morning as possible for these appointments. You may be asked to see another family doctor in the FHO if I cannot accommodate you. As this appointment is fit in at the same time as another patient's pre-booked appointment, I will only deal with that one problem at that visit to be considerate to the other patients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow-up-appointments (10-15 minutes)</strong> for chronic medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis), well child/baby visits, visits for non-urgent concerns, prenatal visits, etc. This is the most likely visit you will book. <u>If you are returning for a follow-up covering multiple issues or especially if you need time to talk (for instance about stress or mood concerns)</u>, <strong>You must tell this to my staff when booking the appointment and she will give you a 20-30 minute appointment (you do not have to give details on the phone unless you want to)</strong>. Do not “save up” all your problems for one visit as I will not be able to adequately deal with them in a followup visit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Checkups (20-30 minutes)</strong> are comprehensive physical exams that will allow for things like immunizations and referrals for screening such as a mammogram, blood work and bone densitometry. It is also a good time to discuss general health questions and concerns. Sometimes I will give you a lab requisition ahead of time to do before your check up. If blood tests are to be done after the morning appointment, you can do them in the building if you to come for the appointment fasting for 12 hours: no breakfast, but drinking plain water is fine, and you may take your medications (except diabetes medication). It is very important that you bring all your medications (including over the counter drugs and herbals) with you, so they can be reviewed at that time. Because of the amount of time booked, we ask that you give us at least 24 hours notice if canceling, so that someone else can be booked in that time slot. It is your responsibility to keep track of all your appointments. You will be charged for failing to show without proper notice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Talks (20-30 minutes)</strong> This is an ideal time to talk about multiple concerns. If you have mental health concerns or stress that is affecting your normal level of functioning, this is also the right appointment for you.</li>
