                <h3>VACCINATION UPDATE - OCTOBER 7 2015</h3>
                <p>Influenza shots have now arrived at the office. I recommend everyone be vaccinated, especially those in high risk groups for complications of the flu(see note below from last fall). Public health is especially urging pregnant women, daycare providers and children age 6 months to 5 years of age be vaccinated. This year the shot for 6 months to 5 years contains 4 strains of the vaccine for extra coverage, given flu is so common in this age group. Please call to book an appointment.</p>
                <h3>If you are 65 or over and get your flu shot elsewhere, please let me know.</h3>
                <p>You can use Fluwatch from the Public Helath Agency of Canada to keep informed on Influenza in Canada: http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch/</p>
                <p>There is also a nasal flu vaccine(FluMist) which you can purchase for $30 as an alternative to the flu shot for people over 2 years of age. Call the office if you would prefer this for you or your child.</p>
                <p>This fall, I will also be giving flu shots on a drop in basis when I am working after hours in Suite 201. You can call Joan re when those dates will be. After 5:00 parking is free on the street.</p>
                <p>You can also be updated for Tetanus and Pneumovax, if these apply to you.</p>
                <p>Canada&#39;s National Advisory Committee on Immunization advised in 2010 that children receive a second dose of chickenpox vaccine. In Ontario children who are eligible should receive a second dose. They need to be born on or after Jan. 1, 2000 and have not had chickenpox . I also recommend older children receive the vaccine and can give parents a prescription for this that they would bring to the office with their child at an appointment.</p>
                <p>There is also a shingles shot(Zostavax) available with a prescription, for those 50 years and older. This boosts your immunity and decreases the risk of shingles.If you want this, we can call a presciption to a pharmacy and you bring it in. The vaccine is frozen and has to be kept in the fridge until administered. It is also available from the pharmacy in my building.</p>
                <p>Please call the office to come in for your shot. I do recommend that <strong>ALL</strong> my patients get a flu shot each fall, but especially those who fall into a high risk group for complications of influenza as outlined in the following table:</p>

                <h3>May 24, 2012  SHINGLES VACCINE</h3>
                <p>The Shingles Vaccine (Zostavax) shortage is over in Ottawa and it is readily available at pharmacies. The pharmacy in my building has a good supply now and I can call a presciption there or to the pharmacy of your choice. Then you would book a quick appointment and pick up the vaccine prior to coming.<strong>Please do not go to a Shingles Vaccine Clinic in East or West Ottawa</strong> as these are organized by a walk in clinic and being seen at a clinic is against the Patient Commitment that was signed when you enroled as a patient-to seek medical care at my office or my after hours clinic when you are my patient.</p>
                <hr />
                <h3>FEB 20 2012</h3>
                <p>Many of you have been to the new office by now. For those who have not-I have appointment spots available daily and work Tuesday evenings. There are also evening clinics Monday to Thursday where you can be seen as well. Starting March 3, there will be Saturday morning clinics as well. Please call as early as possible if you need an appointment and listen to the answering machine message for instructions. If you leave a message, please spell your full name and give a phone number where you can be reached. </p>
                <h3>YOUR CHECKUP</h3>
                <p>As per the letter I sent to all patients, I do expect that all patients will come in for a complete checkup once every 1-2 years. This is especially important for those over 50 years old. As part of your checkup I will arrange appropriate screening tests that are recommended. To learn more about some of the recommended cancer screening for people who have no complaints and feel fine, go to: <a href="http://www.cancercare.on.ca">www.cancercare.on.ca</a> and <a href="http://www.healthyontario.com">www.healthyontario.com</a>.</p>
                <p>I provide the best care and give advice when I see you for your checkup, as there is more time to review your health overall and this is how I prefer to work.</p>
                <h3>VITAMIN D TESTING</h3>
                <p>OHIP will no longer pay for screening Vitamin D levels. You can still have it done but you would pay for the test. My advice to all my adult patients is to follow Canada&#39;s Food Guide for dairy intake and take 1000 units of Vitamin D daily. If most days you do not have 15 minutes of sun exposure, increase the supplement to 2000 units a day. </p>
                <h3>YOUR TEST RESULTS</h3>
                <p>All test results are reviewed by me (or the doctor covering me when I am off) upon their arrival. The secretary, will call you to offer you an appointment to review any abnormal results. Results cannot be given over the phone as they do require explanation by me as well as communication as to the management plan. Due to the volume of results that arrive daily to the office, we cannot notify patients of normal results. However, if you are concerned and have not received a call,I suggest you SCHEDULE A RETURN APPOINTMENT 2 WEEKS AFTER YOU DO THE TEST to discuss your test results, review your progress and address any questions you may have. . Of course, if you are having ongoing problems after a test, regardless of whether you were called or not, I expect you would book a follow up appointment. </p>
