                <h3>Flu shots have arrived for fall 2017</h3>
                <h3>Flu shots</h3>
                <p>I recommend everyone be vaccinated, every fall, especially those in high risk groups for complications of the flu(see note below). Public health especially urges pregnant women, daycare providers and children age 6 months to 5 years of age be vaccinated. Please call to book an appointment from October to the end of December.</p>
                <h3>If you are 65 or over and get your flu shot elsewhere, please let us know.</h3>
                <p>You can use Fluwatch from the Public Health Agency of Canada to keep informed on Influenza in Canada: <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch/">http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch/</a>.</p>
                <p>There is also a nasal flu vaccine(FluMist) which is an alternative to the injected flu vaccine for people over 2 years of age who have a needle phobia. Call the office if you would prefer this for you or your child.</p>
                <p>I also give flu shots on a drop in basis when I am working after hours in Suite 201. You can call my staff regarding what those dates are. After 5:00 parking is free on the street.</p>
                <p>You can also be updated for other vaccines you are due for at the same time.</p>
                <p>Please call the office to come in for your shot. I do recommend that <strong>ALL</strong> my patients get a flu shot each fall, but especially those who fall into a high risk group for complications of influenza as outlined here:</p>
                <h3>Recommended Recipients of Influenza Vaccine<a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/10vol36/acs-6/t31">*</a></h3>

                </ul>
                <h4>People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Health care and other care providers in facilities and community settings who, through their activities, are capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk of influenza complications.</li>
                    <li>Household contacts (adults and children) of individuals at high risk of influenza-related complications (whether or not the individual at high risk has been immunized):</li>
                    <li>household contacts of individuals at high risk, as listed in the section above;</li>
                    <li>household contacts of infants &gt;6 months of age who are at high risk of complications from influenza but for whom influenza vaccine is not authorized ; and</li>
                    <li>members of a household expecting a newborn during the influenza season.</li>
                    <li>Those providing regular child care to children &gt;59 months of age, whether in or out of the home.</li>
                    <li>Those who provide services within closed or relatively closed settings to persons at high risk (e. g. crew on a ship).</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Others</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>People who provide essential community services.</li>
                    <li>People in direct contact during culling operations with poultry infected with avian influenza.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Special consideration</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Persons who are morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 40).</li>
                    <li>Aboriginal people.</li>
                    <li>Healthy children 2 to 4 years of age.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>* Note: Healthy persons aged 5 to 64 years without contraindication are also encouraged to receive influenza vaccine even if they are not in one of the priority groups.</p>
                <h3>Chickenpox and shingles vaccines</h3>
                <p>Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization advised in 2010 that children receive a second dose of chickenpox vaccine. In Ontario children who are eligible should receive a second dose. They need to be born on or after Jan. 1, 2000 and have not had chickenpox. I also recommend older children receive the vaccine and can give parents a prescription for this that they would bring to the office with their child at an appointment.</p>
                <p>There is also a shingles shot (Zostavax) available with a prescription, for those 50 years and older. As of the Fall 2016, OHIP covered the shingles shot for patients 65-70 years old. This boosts your immunity and decreases the risk of shingles and the severity of shingles if you do develop it. If you want this, we can call a prescription to a pharmacy and you bring it in. The vaccine must be kept in the fridge until administered. It is also available from the pharmacy in my building.</p>
                <h3>Pneumonia shots</h3>
                <p>Pneumovax 23 has long been given to patients over 65 years old or with a chronic health problem such as asthma or heart disease at a younger age. This is free under OHIP.</p>
                <p>Prevnar-13 is given to babies and to patients with certain chronic health problems. OHIP does not cover the cost of the vaccine otherwise but you can get a prescription for this vaccine and bring it in to be given by me. After 6-12 months Pneumovax 23 can be given. </p>
                <h3>Travel shots</h3>
                <p>Visits and immunizations for travel outside of Canada are NOT covered by OHIP as above. I do not see patients for travel related concerns. You need to book far in advance with one of the Travel Medicine Clinics.</p>
                <h3>Your checkup</h3>
                <p>I do expect that medically complex patients will come in for a complete checkup once a year. This is especially important for those over 50 years old. As part of your checkup I will arrange appropriate screening tests that are recommended. To learn more about some of the recommended cancer screening for people who have no complaints and feel fine, go to: <a href="www.cancercare.on.ca">www.cancercare.on.ca</a> and <a href="www.healthyontario.com">www.healthyontario.com</a>.</p>
                <p>I provide the best care and give advice when I see you for your checkup, as there is more time to review your health overall.</p>
                <h3>Vitamin D testing</h3>
                <p>OHIP will not pay for screening Vitamin D levels. You can still have it done but you would pay for the test. My advice to all my adult patients is to follow Canada's Food Guide for dairy intake and take 1000 units of Vitamin D daily. If most days you do not have 15 minutes of sun exposure and during the winter, increase the supplement to 2000 units a day.</p>
                <h3>Your test results</h3>
                <p>All test results are reviewed by me (or the doctor covering me when I am off) upon their arrival. We generally notify you of results that were investigating a particular problem. The secretary will call you to convey a brief message that I send to her. <strong>She cannot give you advice further to what I tell her. If anything is unclear, ask her for clarification and she will either check with me and phone you back or book an appointment with me either via phone or again in person</strong>. However, if you are concerned and have not received a call,I suggest you schedule a return appointment to discuss your test results, review your progress and address any questions you may have. Of course, if you are having ongoing or worsening problems after a test, regardless of whether you were called or not, I expect you would book a follow up appointment.</p>
